 In this Game, You as the User will be starting your journey towards your first look at BLACK JACK!
 
-
This version of Black Jack was developed By Justin Kimâ„¢

- Black Jack is essentially a card game played by 2 or more players or computer opponents.
- It can be played together as players vs the "House"(Dealer) or against each other FFA(Free For All) style.
- this version created by me will be a single player game against the computer.

####Rules of Black Jack

1. You as the Player will be initially dealt two cards as your starting hand.
 - cards with value of 1 - 10 are as stated.
 - Suit cards or more commonly referred as "Face" cards have a value of 10
 - Ace card can have a value of 1 or 11 depending on what you want!
2. you will be able to see one card in the dealers hand to kind of guess what he has.
3. You will choose to either to hit or stand if you are close to 21
4. In the case you were dealt 21 (A,10 or Suit) YOU WIN! unless...the dealer also has 21...booo...
